================

Simple processing sketch to create Moire patterns

You can set the number of circles in the scene from the moire.pde file. There's one preset pattern that you can use by calling setupMoireCross() from setup in the same file.

Distance between lines, colors, etc are controlled through the MoireCircle class.
